r"""End-to-end harness for RDS Proxy auto-detection, against pre-existing infrastructure.

Unlike ``e2e_integration_test.py``, this harness **provisions nothing and deletes
nothing**. It points at RDS instances and proxies that already exist in your
account, because RDS Proxy auto-detection only applies to standalone RPG
instances -- a topology the provisioning harness lists as "planned, not yet
supported".

Every query it issues is read-only (``SELECT``), and it never creates, alters, or
drops a database object. That makes it safe to aim at an existing instance whose
data you care about. It still connects as whatever role your configured secret
names, so prefer a least-privilege read-only role.

What it verifies
----------------

1. **Discovery** -- ``find_proxy_for_instance`` finds the proxy that fronts the
   instance, and the endpoint it returns matches what ``describe_db_proxies``
   reports. Cross-checked independently of the function under test.

2. **TLS under verify-full** -- the proxy presents a certificate that the bundled
   Amazon CA set actually verifies, *including hostname verification*. This is
   the check that cannot be unit-tested: the proxy has its own hostname
   (``*.proxy-<id>.<region>.rds.amazonaws.com``) and its own certificate, and the
   server now defaults to ``sslmode=verify-full``. Asserted from OpenSSL's verify
   return code, not merely logged.

3. **Connect and query through the proxy** -- the connection's host is the proxy
   endpoint, and a real ``SELECT`` succeeds over it. Also confirms, from the
   server's own view, that the backend really is reached via the proxy.

4. **Secret resolution** -- a per-target ``--secret_arn`` override keyed on the
   *instance* endpoint still resolves when the connection is routed to a proxy.
   The live analogue of
   ``test_per_target_secret_arn_keys_off_instance_not_proxy_endpoint``.

5. **Transparency to the caller** -- the connection is cached under the endpoint
   the caller supplied, the proxy host never enters the key space, and the connect
   response reports the instance endpoint with ``proxy_endpoint`` alongside it.
   ``run_query`` raises on a cache miss rather than reconnecting, so a key
   mismatch here would mean every query through a proxy fails.

6. **Negative control** -- an instance with *no* proxy falls back to a direct
   connection. Skipped unless ``--no-proxy-instance`` is supplied; without it
   suite 3 alone cannot distinguish "routed through the proxy" from "ignored the
   proxy and happened to work".

Prerequisites
-------------

- Network reachability from this host to the proxy endpoint on the Postgres port.
  RDS Proxy is normally private, so this generally means running from inside the
  VPC (or over VPN/DirectConnect with the proxy's security group allowing you).
- AWS credentials with ``rds:DescribeDBInstances``, ``rds:DescribeDBProxies``,
  ``rds:DescribeDBProxyTargets``, and ``secretsmanager:GetSecretValue`` on the
  secret in use. A read-only role is sufficient: nothing here mutates anything.
- A password for the ``pg_wire_secret`` path. Normally nothing to do -- the server
  discovers the instance's ``MasterUserSecret`` itself. ``--secret-arn`` is only
  needed when the instance has no managed master password, or to exercise the
  per-target override lookup.
- For ``--auth-type pg_wire_iam``: an ``rds-db:connect`` policy scoped to the
  **proxy** resource (``prx-*``), not the instance. See the README.

Usage
-----
    # Password auth via Secrets Manager (most common)
    python tests/e2e/proxy_e2e_test.py \
        --region us-east-1 \
        --db-instance-identifier my-proxied-instance \
        --database postgres \
        --secret-arn arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:my-secret

    # Add the negative control, and test IAM auth too
    python tests/e2e/proxy_e2e_test.py \
        --region us-east-1 \
        --db-instance-identifier my-proxied-instance \
        --no-proxy-instance my-bare-instance \
        --database postgres \
        --auth-type pg_wire_iam

See ``tests/e2e/run_proxy_e2e.sh`` for a wrapper that refreshes credentials first.
